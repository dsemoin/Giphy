Chemistry Giphy.

This assigment is to practice getting data from an api key.

This was very useful because I got to practice the skills that I previously learned while applying new knowledge.

Users can use this by clicking on the existing buttons to see the gifs, they can click on the buttons to make them stop, and they can add new buttons.

Users can ask me about the project or view the code source.
